# Advanced HTML5 Techniques
### Mark Addinall - December 2015
----

HTML5-based APIs, but also introducing other advanced features related to HTML5, such as Web components, advanced multimedia, audio for music and games, etc. 


- Advanced multimedia features with the Timed Text Track and WebAudio APIs,
- HTML5 games techniques,
- Persistence techniques for data storage including IndexedDB, File upload and download using Ajax, Drag and drop,
- Web Components, Web Workers, Orientation APIs and others...

Since I am now working on several "full stack" projects, one my home ground PHP+ the rest, a Python stack and a MEAN stack, I thought it was time to seperate the HTML into a "pure" HTML experimental area.  There is enough to read and write about in the stack backend(s) so the front end information gets drowned by noise.

Help yourself to anything that takes your fancy.

Merry Christmas,

Mark Addinall.
