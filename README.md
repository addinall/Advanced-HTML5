# Advanced HTML5 Techniques
### Mark Addinall - December 2015
----

HTML5-based APIs, but also introducing other advanced features related to HTML5, such as Web components, advanced multimedia, audio for music and games, etc. 


- Advanced multimedia features with the Timed Text Track and WebAudio APIs,
- HTML5 games techniques,
- Persistence techniques for data storage including IndexedDB, File upload and download using Ajax, Drag and drop,
- Web Components, Web Workers, Orientation APIs and others...

Since I am now working on several "full stack" projects, one my home ground PHP+ the rest, a Python stack and a MEAN stack, I thought it was time to seperate the HTML into a "pure" HTML experimental area.  There is enough to read and write about in the stack backend(s) so the front end information gets drowned by noise.

So this whole section is HTML5 - CSS3 goodies manipulated by Vanilla javascript.


NEWS FLASH!  I decided to expand my area of interest in the graphics section from just plain vanilla Javascript but to include a couple of the newer libraries.  I am having a look at Phaser and Create.  Both can be found in the games sub-structure of this project page.

CreateJS terminated.  I had a look at it over night and if anything it is MORE wordy than doing it with Vanilla JS.  I can't see the point really.  I will continue with Phaser.  That looks a little more sensible.

Help yourself to anything that takes your fancy.

Happy New Year.

Mark Addinall.
